# Bullfrog
This is my first pygame project. It started as a frogger clone. It's now a strange mix between Frogger and Alien Invasion. There are 2 levels and 2 enemy types. The game will record and save your high score and the volume settings if you change them and press the save button in the settings menu.


### Controls
Move left, right, up, and down with the arrow keys.
Press 'esc' key to pause the game.
